        <div class="header" id="a1">Pop music</div>

        <div class="header" id="a2">Hip hop music</div>
        <p>Hip hop or rap music formed in the United States in the 1970s and consists of stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rhythmic and rhyming speech ("rapping").</p>

        <p>A genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later. Compared to pop music, rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and an ideology of authenticity.</p>
        <div class="header" id="a4">Jazz music</div>
        <p>A music genre that originated from African American communities of New Orleans during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation.</p>

        <div class="header" id="a7">Funk</div>
        <p>A music genre that originated in the 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music that de-emphasized melody and chord progressions to bring a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line and drum part to the foreground.</p>
